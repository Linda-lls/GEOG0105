# GEOG0105
Here are the Python code scripts for develpoing the first large-scale walkability quantification model in South Africa using SegFormer and Google Street View Imagery.

1_sample_points_collection_update: Provide coding used for sample points collection.
2_GSV_collection_size_test: Provide coding used for test best size of GSV for SegFormer-B5.
3_GSV_image_collection: Provide coding used for GSV collection.
4_Data_Cleaning_1: Provide coding used for GSV cleaning.
5_SegFormer_proportion：Provide coding used to calculate proportion of each selected labels by SegFormer.
6_IVW_Calculation: Provide coding used to calculate the value of four sub-indicators and IVW.
7_Spatial_Patterns_of_IVW_update_1: Provide coding used to visualize spatial patterns of IVW and four sub-indicators.
8_Validation_of_IVW_update: Provide coding used to sample points selection, merge selected GSV images into 360 view panorama and Pearson’s Correlation Analysis for validation.
9_Spatial_regression_update: Provide coding used to conduct spatial regression and visualize spatial patterns of multiple deprivations. 
10_Example_Display_update: Provide coding used to show segmentation categories, displays of results of segmentation and displays of GSV in different level of sub-indicators.
